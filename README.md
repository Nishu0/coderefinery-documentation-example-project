# Inspiration:

Climate Change Research: Climate scientists may be interested in analyzing temperature data to better understand how the climate is changing over time.
A Python script that can import and analyze temperature data from various sources could be a useful tool in this research.

Agriculture and Farming: Farmers and agricultural researchers may be interested in analyzing temperature data to determine the best times for planting and harvesting crops. A Python script that can identify seasonal trends in temperature data and generate forecasts of future temperature values could be a valuable tool in this field.

## About Project

The project is designed to take an Excel spreadsheet as input, which contains temperature data in a specific format. The user can customize the format of the input data by specifying
the location and format of the temperature data columns in the script. Once the input data is loaded, the script calculates various 
statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range of the temperature data.

Overall, the "Temperature analysis via Spreadsheet" project provides a simple and powerful tool for analyzing temperature data in Excel spreadsheets. It allows users to quickly 
obtain insights about temperature patterns over time and make informed decisions based on the analysis.

## Setup

You will need ``` Python 3.5 ```


This project depends on panda library install in on our system
``` pip install pandas ```


## Features

The user can perform the following actions on this project

### User-Friendly Interface: 


The project have an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface that allows users to import data and perform temperature analysis with minimal technical expertise.

### Data Import: 

The project allows users to import temperature data from a variety of sources, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and databases.

### Data Cleaning:

We have also done data preprocessing to clean the temperature data by removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and correcting erroneous data.

### Statistical Modeling: 

The project have used statistical models to the temperature data, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or linear regression, to identify significant predictors of temperature fluctuations.

### Data Visualization: 

The project also allows user the certain types of visualizations, such as scatterplots or heatmaps, to help users identify trends and relationships in the temperature data.

### Forecasting: 

In this project we forecasts the future temperature values based on historical data and the best-fit statistical models.

### Reporting: 

The script should be able to generate a summary report that presents the results of the analysis, including visualizations, tables, and key insights.

### Customization: 

The script should allow users to customize various aspects of the analysis, such as the time period of interest, the type of statistical model used, or the visualization options.
